# Ant Colony Simulator
Whilst working on a maze generator/solver in pygame, i got stuck on what searching algorithm to use. I researched different heuristic search algorithms, and i saw "Ant Colony Optimization".\
This made me remember a sebastian lague video on ant and slime simulation, I decided to take up the challenge of writing an ant colony simulator in pygame. \
It is incomplete. \
All that works right now is that an ant goes to the nearest food in a list of foods.\

## Requirements
You'll need pygame and numpy.\
You can install them however you please, but ive made a handy little requirements.txt file, to make your pip installing a little easier!\
Simply run this, and you should be up and running!:\
```pip install -r requirements.txt```
